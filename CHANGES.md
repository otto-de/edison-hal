# Change Log

## 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT

*New Features / API extensions*

* Adds method `Links.Builder#collection(String)` to add a collection link to a HalResourceÂ´s `_links` section.

*Deprecations*

* Addes deprecation for `HalRepresentation` constructors with `Curies` parameter. No expected usages - but please
  contact me, if the removal in some future release 3.0 will break some use-cases for you.
  
## 2.0.2

*Bugfixes*

* Fixed issues when more than two parameters in the Traverson.withVars() function.

## 2.0.1

*Bugfixes*

* Fixes next page bug for zero-based paging (Issue #24)

## 2.0.0

*New Features / API extensions*

* Issue 23: Allow customization of the Jackson `ObjectMapper` used in `HalParser` `Traverson`.

*Dependency Updates*
* Updated `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` from 2.9.1 to 2.9.6
* Updated `com.damnhandy:handy-uri-templates` from 2.1.6 to 2.1.7
 
## 2.0.0-m2

*Bugfixes*

* Issue 22: Duplicate curies are now removed from embedded objects, if they are specified in the embedding `HalRepresentation`.

*Breaking Changes*

* The API to create Links instances has changed: the former `Links.linkingTo(List<Link>)`, 
`Links.linkingTo(Link, Link...)` is now replaced by `Links.linkingTo()` which is returning a `Links.Builder`. The 
reason for this is that it is now possible to specify more easily, whether a `Link` should be rendered as a single
link object, or an array of link objects. The `Links.Builder` has now methods for this like, for example, 
`single(Link, Link...)` or `array(Link, Link...)`. Have a look at 
[section 4.3](#4.3-single-link-objects-vs.-arrays-of-link-objects) for more details about adding links to a
`HalRepresentation`.  
* Because the `Links.Builder` is now able to create single link objects as well as arrays of link objects, the 
corresponding functionality to register link-relation types to be rendered as arrays has been removed from 
`RelRegistry`.
* Issue 21: Similar to the links, it is now possible to specify whether or not embedded resources are embedded as 
single resource objects, or arrays of resources objects.
* Renamed `RelRegistry` to `Curies`     
* Issue 20: HalRepresentation was previously annotated with @JsonInclude(NON_NULL). This was changed so that only 
_links and _embedded are now annotated this way. This might change the behaviour / structure of existing applications.
  You should now annotate classes extending HalRepresentation, or attributes of such classes appropriately.
  
## 2.0.0-m1

*Breaking Changes*

* The error handling in the Traverson API has been changed in that exceptions are now thrown instead of catching them 
and exposing a `Traverson.getLastError()`. In 1.0.0, the client had to check for the last error. This is rather unusual 
and is easy to overlook. Beginning with 2.0.0, `getLastError` is removed and the following method-signatures are now 
throwing `java.io.IOException`:
  * Traverson.paginateNext()  
  * Traverson.paginateNextAs()  
  * Traverson.paginatePrev()  
  * Traverson.paginatePrevAs()
  * Traverson.stream()
  * Traverson.streamAs()
  * Traverson.getResource()  
  * Traverson.getResourceAs()
* The static factory method `Traverson.traverson()` does not accept a `java.util.function.Function<Link,String>` 
anymore. Instead, a `de.otto.edison.hal.traverson.LinkResolver` was introduced. The major difference between the new
`PageHandler` and the previous `Function` is that the `PageHandler.apply(Link)` is now throwing `IOException` while
`Function` does not allow this.
* For the same reasons (being able to throw IOExceptions), the different `paginate*` methods now expect a 
`de.otto.edison.hal.traverson.PageHandler` instead of a `java.util.function.Function<Traverson,Boolean>`. Beside of this,
using dedicated functional interfaces instead of generic Functions is a little easier to understand.    
  

*New Features / API extensions* 

* The `Traverson` now supports traversing linked resources while ignoring embedded resources: instead of returning an 
embedded item, clients are now able to force the `Traverson` to follow the links instead. This is especially helpful,
if only a reduced set of attributes is embedded into a resource. A set of `Traverson.followLink()` methods was added
to support this.
* Added new methods `Traverson.paginate()` and `Traverson.paginateAs()` to paginate over paged resources using 
link-relation types other than `next` or `prev`.
* Added a `CuriTemplate` helper to expand / shorten link-relation types using a CURI.  

## 1.0.0

*New Features / API extensions* 
* It is now possible to configure the link-relation types that are serialized as an array of links.
* Parsing of nested embedded items
* Support for curies in deeply nested embedded items
* The HalParser now supports multiple type infos so more than one link-relation type can
be configured with the type of the embedded items. 
* Support for parsing and accessing attributes that were not mapped to properties of HalRepresentations
* Added TRACE logging to Traverson to make it easier to analyse the behaviour of the Traverson.

## 1.0.0.RC5

*Bugfixes*

* Fixed signature of HalRepresentation.withEmbedded(): using List<? extends HalRepresentation
instead of List<HalRepresentation

## 1.0.0.RC4

*New Features / API extensions*

* Added support for traversal auf HAL documents with relative hrefs.

## 1.0.0.RC3

*New Features / API extensions*

* Added `Traverson.getResourceAs(Class<T>, EmbeddedTypeInfo)` and `Traverson.streamAs(Class<T>, EmbeddedTypeInfo>
so it is possible to specify the type of embedded items of a resource using Traversons.
* Added support for client-side traversal of paged resources using
    - `Traverson.paginateNext()`
    - `Traverson.paginateNextAs()`
    - `Traverson.paginatePrev()`
    - `Traverson.paginatePrevAs()`
    - `Traverson.paginate()`
    - `Traverson.paginateAs()`

## 1.0.0.RC2

 so links and embedded items can be added after construction.

*Bufixes*

* JsonSerializers and -Deserializers for Links and Embedded are now public to avoid problems with some testing szenarios in Spring.

## 0.4.0

 templated links. Whether or not a link is templated is now automatically
 identified by the Link.
